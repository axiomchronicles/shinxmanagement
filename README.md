- **Databases**:
  - **SQLite** (Relational Database)
  - **Electrus** (NoSQL In-memory Database, Hyper Fast)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Aquilify**: Aquilify is an ASGI web server. Install it using the following:
   ```bash
   pip install aquilify
   ```

2. **SQLite**: SQLite is used as the relational database for storing user data.
   
3. **Electrus**: Electrus is a NoSQL memory-based database used for fast, real-time interactions. Install it using:
   ```bash
   pip install electrus
   ```

4. **Python**: Python 3.x is required for running the backend.
   
### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ShinxManagement.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ShinxManagement
   ```

3. Install required Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up the SQLite database by running the following command:
   ```bash
   python setup_db.py
   ```

5. Run the Aquilify ASGI server:
   ```bash
   aquilify run app:app
   ```

   The app will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000/` (or your specified port).

### Frontend

The frontend of the application is built using pure **HTML**, **CSS** (with **TailwindCSS**), and **JavaScript**. It is a responsive, user-friendly interface designed to work across devices.

### Backend

The backend is powered by **Aquilify**, an ASGI web server. It handles user authentication, account management, and interacts with two databases:

- **SQLite**: Stores user data, passwords, and transactional information.
- **Electrus**: Used for fast, memory-based storage of temporary data for quick processing.
